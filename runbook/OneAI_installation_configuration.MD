# IBM Watson Machine Learning 2.0 Add-on Installation

Assumption : In order to deploy IBM Watson Machine Learning 2.0 it requires IBM Watson Studio Local 2.0 base installation to be already deployed on the cluster. 
So the below steps outlined are followed based on this assumption.

##  Installation/Configuration of Watson Machine Learning 2.0 

1. Download the IBM Watson Machine Learning add-on Evaluation software (wml_module.tar) from the <IBM Software Repository>. This downloadable package is around 16GB in size and requires IBM ID to download.

2. You can download the Watson Machine Learning software add-on package to the /ibm/InstallPackage/modules directory. On successful download the file exists as /ibm/InstallPackage/modules/wml_module.tar  

3. Now we are all set deploy the IBM Watson Machine Learning add-on package. Go to /ibm/InstallPackage/components directory and execute the below command
        ```cd /ibm/InstallPackage/components```
